# Myntra Clone

A simple, non-functional clone of the Myntra home page created using HTML and CSS. This project is intended for learning purposes, focusing on replicating the look and feel of the Myntra home page.

## Overview

This project is a static web page that replicates the design of Myntra's home page. It does not include any interactive features or backend functionality. The primary goal is to practice HTML and CSS skills by replicating a real-world application design.

## Features

- **Static Layout**: A single page that replicates the look of Myntra’s home page.
- **Responsive Design**: The page adjusts to different screen sizes, providing a basic responsive layout.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the content of the home page.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/myntra-clone.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage
